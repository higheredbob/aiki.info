{
	*Ai* is balance, harmony.  *Ki* is spirit, energy.  *Do* is a way of life.  *Aikido* is the art of *saving the enemy*.  He fights with care and grace, defending himself, seeking peace, and protecting the aggressor from harm.  Aiki achieves a practical balance between violence and non-violence.  The fighter neither harms his enemy nor allows himself to be harmed, although there may be some pain and minor injury along the way!
|
	*ai.ki* is a place for Aikido, for people who love Aiki, and for groups that practise Aiki.  Aiki is more than a way to fight, it is a way of life.  Therefore, much of what you may find here is not directly concerned with combat and physical training.  We do aspire to live peacefully, fight gently when we must, and apply Aiki to our everyday lives.
