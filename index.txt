	*Ai*: balance, harmony.  *Ki*: spirit, energy.  *Dō*: path, way.

	*Aikidō* is the way of *balanced spirit*, the art of *saving the enemy*, the art of *peace*.  The Aikidōka fights with care, seeking peace, protecting the aggressor from harm.
	
	Aikidō is the practical balance between violence and non-violence.  The Aiki fighter does not harm the enemy, nor allow herself to be harmed, although there may be some pain or minor injury along the way!
	
	Aikidō: a joyful dance, a vigorous sport, the best strategy.

	*ai.ki* is a place for Aikidō on the Internet, for people who love Aikidō, and for groups that practise Aikidō.
	
	Aiki is more than a way to fight, it is a way of life.  Therefore, much of what you may find here is not directly concerned with combat or physical training.
	
	We host and link to sites about Aikidō, Aikidō dōjōs, and some other personal, group, and business sites.  The people and groups here aspire to live peacefully, fight gently if we must, and apply Aiki in our everyday lives.
|
	We wish to promote the Aiki spirit to the world: peace, gentleness, strength without violence.
	
	For those who agree with the priciples of Aiki, we offer web hosting, linking, email addresses, and sub-domains.  This site is very new, please help us to improve it and to grow.
	
	Please contact sam@ai.ki for more information.
