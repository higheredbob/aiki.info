# *Ai*: balance, harmony.  *Ki*: spirit, energy.  *Do*: path, way.
# 
# *Aikido* is the way of *balanced spirit*, the art of *saving the enemy*.  We fight with care, seeking peace, protecting the aggressor from harm.
# 
# 殺人剣 - 活人剣
# 
# Aikido is the practical balance between non-violence and self defence.  The true Aiki fighter can succeed without doing any real harm, although there may be some pain or minor injury along the way!
# 
# Aikido: a joyful dance, a vital sport, the art of peace, the best strategy.

# Study how water flows in a valley stream, smoothly and freely between the rocks.  Also learn from holy books and wise people.  Everything - even mountains, rivers, plants and trees - should be your teacher.

# To injure an opponent is to injure yourself.  To control aggression without inflicting injury is the Art of Peace.
