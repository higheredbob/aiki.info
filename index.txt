	=合氣道=

	*Ai*: balance, harmony.  *Ki*: spirit, energy.  *Dō*: path, way.

	*Aikidō* is the way of *balanced spirit*, the art of *saving the enemy*.  We fight with care, seeking peace, protecting the aggressor from harm.
	
	Aikidō is the practical balance between non-violence and self defence.  The true Aiki fighter can succeed without doing any real harm, although there may be some pain or minor injury along the way!
	
	Aikidō: a joyful dance, a vital sport, the art of peace, the best strategy.

	*ai.ki* is a place for Aikidō on the Internet, for people who love Aikidō, and for groups that practise Aikidō.
	
	Aiki is more than a way to fight, it is a way of life.  Therefore, much of what you may find here is not directly concerned with combat or physical training.
	
	We host and link to sites about Aikidō, Aikidō dōjōs, and some other personal, group, and business sites.  The people and groups here aspire to live peacefully, fight gently if we must, and apply Aiki in our everyday lives.

	Study how water flows in a valley stream, smoothly and freely between the rocks.  Also learn from holy books and wise people.  Everything - even mountains, rivers, plants and trees - should be your teacher. 

	To injure an opponent is to injure yourself.  To control aggression without inflicting injury is the Art of Peace.
