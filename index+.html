<b>Ai</b>: balance, harmony.&nbsp; <b>Ki</b>: spirit, energy.&nbsp; <b>Dō</b>: path, way.<br>
<br>
<b>Aikidō</b> is the way of <b>balanced spirit</b>, the art of <b>saving the enemy</b>, the art of <b>peace</b>.&nbsp; The Aikidōka fights with care, seeking peace, protecting the aggressor from harm.<br>
<br>
Aikidō is the practical balance between violence and non-violence.&nbsp; The Aiki fighter does not harm the enemy, nor allow herself to be harmed, although there may be some pain or minor injury along the way!<br>
<br>
Aikidō: a joyful dance, a vigorous sport, the best strategy.<br>

<b>ai.ki</b> is a place for Aikidō on the Internet, for people who love Aikidō, and for groups that practise Aikidō.<br>
<br>
Aiki is more than a way to fight, it is a way of life.&nbsp; Therefore, much of what you may find here is not directly concerned with combat or physical training.<br>
<br>
We host and link to sites about Aikidō, Aikidō dōjōs, and some other personal, group, and business sites.&nbsp; The people and groups here aspire to live peacefully, fight gently if we must, and apply Aiki in our everyday lives.<br>
</td><td>
We wish to promote the Aiki spirit to the world: peace, gentleness, strength without violence.<br>
<br>
For those who agree with the priciples of Aiki, we offer web hosting, linking, email addresses, and sub-domains.&nbsp; These services are available free of charge, or you can "pay what you feel".&nbsp; This site is very new, please help us to improve it and to grow.<br>
