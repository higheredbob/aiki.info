Hi there Aikido peoples, I hope this will be of interest.

I'm offering Internet web and email hosting at the ai.ki domain.  It's free of charge, or you can "pay what you feel" for the service.

For example, I made a small page about Aikido at http://ai.ki/, my email address is sam@ai.ki, and my personal web site is at http://sam.ai.ki/  I'm happy to host web sites about Aikido, and also other sites by people who love Aikido.  I can also redirect and link to existing sites.

The ai.ki domain name costs AU$1000 per year to rent from the Republic of
Kiribati.  I'm hoping by sharing the domain I will be able to cover some of the
costs of renting it, however I'm fine with giving free services too.
