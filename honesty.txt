I'm thinking of some concepts around honesty:

honesty - tell the truth about the past and present, what is known
honour - tell the truth about the future; keep my word as best I can
acceptance - limits to foresight, control; can't always keep my word
prudence - don't make unwise commitments; guard my words
privacy - may decline to tell "the whole truth", if no need to know
caution - think twice before an act, that you would try to keep private
tact - do not say something that might cause offense without value
integrity - words are consistent with self and actions; not hypocritical

Not sure if those are the best words for those concepts... can you think of any other important concepts around honesty? (I'm sure there are plenty!)
