It's a great explanation, potentially life-changing for me and others, thank-you.

I was inspired to take notes, which does not happen very often,
and added a "number 8" based on another comment.

Sam's notes:

I added #8 "creative intelligence" based on a comment.
I think this is another important type of intelligence.

Personally I would order the intelligences as follows.  This seems a reasonable
order of priority to me, for a person to learn as they are growing up, or for
an adult to seek further development, although it might be best to develop
several or all intelligences together at once.

1. health and fitness
2. emotional intelligence
3. social intelligence
4. spiritual intelligence
5. right-brain intelligence
6. creative intelligence
7. analytical intelligence
8. commercial intelligence
