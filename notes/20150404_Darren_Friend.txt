Saturday 4th April 2015, Sensei Darren Friend

tai no henko 1:
- 1st step, slide forward, more like kamae distance between the feet, to keep a strong balance.
- 2nd and 3rd steps, push through uke's centre; don't veer too far to the side.
- Arms blend smoothly from kamae up to final position, don't wave them right and left. Top hand goes to eye level.
- Keep the technique at your own height, don't try to go up higher to deal with a giant.
- Push forward as far as you can.

katate-mochi sokumen irmi-nage 1:
- 1st step, don't push against uke's arm and body, leave a gap so he doesn't sense the threat.
- 2nd step, bring hips in to uke's hips, keep arms forward, not off to the left side.

shomen-uchi ikkajo-osae 1:
- Strike with arm strong like kamae.
- Break uke's balance with the first entering slide after the strike.
- Guide with the upper hand, control with the lower hand on the elbow.

katate-mochi nikajo osae 1:
- 1st step, take uke off balance, the strike helps to take uke's balance.
- Raise hand directly like hiriki-no-yosei to take the nikajo.
- 2nd step, go back to a comfortable kamae distance facing uke, so arms are strong like kamae, and not bent, then apply the nikajo. It shouldn't require a great effort to apply the nikajo.

Learn from your teachers, and analyse the techniques for yourself. Ask "why", "how"...
