My materialist muggle approach to aiki, for what it's worth, is that I want to learn techniques that could be performed by a clever humanoid robot.

In other words, I want my techniques to be entirely rational and comprehensible: based on mechanics, not magic. If there are magical techniques, I prefer not to learn them. I have never seen a technique that cannot be understood rationally.

So, for me, I take the word "ki" to mean "energy", "motion", "force" in the physical sense, and "ai" to mean "join", "fitting". I think these are the most rational meanings of those kanji, and it makes good sense to me that way.

I do also find spiritual and philosophical value in budo and aikido. But I like to stay down to earth, and there is plenty of interest for me in learning physical techniques, without resorting to metaphysics.
